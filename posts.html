      <h2>My discovery: how light focuse from a small hole
      </h2>
      <div class="date">January 9th, 2025</div>
      <p>I made a small hole with my hands (like holding water) and looked at a letter through it. To my surprise, the letter looked smaller! As I made the hole bigger, the letter returned to its normal size. It’s all about how light focuses through a tiny opening. Next time you're bored, give it a try—you'll be amazed! 👀✨"

      <h2>Finding radius of Earth

      <p>How to Measure the Earth's Radius with Minimal Resources
        
        
        Want to measure the Earth's radius with just a few tools? Here’s a simple, resource-light method using geometry and sunlight:
        
        Method: Using Shadows and Geometry
        
        What you need:
        1. Two places a known distance apart (800 km or more, preferably on the same meridian).
        2. A protractor or stick to measure the angle of the Sun’s rays at noon.
        3. The distance between the two places.
        
        Steps:
        
        1. Choose Two Locations: Pick two places on the same meridian, separated by at least 800 km.
        
        2. Measure the Sun's Angle: At noon, use a vertical stick to measure the angle of the Sun’s rays at both locations. The Sun will be more overhead at the equator and lower as you move north or south.
        
        3. Find the Difference in Angles: Subtract the two angles to get the angular distance between the two locations on Earth.
        
        4. Apply Geometry: The angle difference represents the fraction of Earth's circumference between the two points. Use the formula:
        
           (d / C) = (angle difference / 360)

   Where `d` is the distance between the locations, and `C` is the Earth's circumference.

5. Calculate Earth's Radius: Once you have the circumference `C`, use the formula for the circumference of a circle:

   C = 2 * pi * r

   Solve for `r` (the Earth's radius):

   r = C / (2 * pi)

This simple method, relying on basic geometry, gives you a great approximation of the Earth’s radius with minimal resources!

      <h2>Automated Railway Crossing Safety Model Using Laser Sensing
      </h2>
      <div class="date">late 2023</div>
      <p>In 2023, during my time in Grade 7, I participated in a science exhibition where I presented an innovative solution designed to enhance safety at railway-road junctions. My project aimed to automate the traditional manual operation performed by personnel stationed at these crossings.

The model utilized a laser sensor system to detect approaching trains. When a train interrupted the laser beam, the system would automatically block the railway crossing and activate a warning buzzer, alerting pedestrians and vehicles to stop. This smart mechanism significantly reduces human effort and enhances safety by providing timely alerts and automatic gate control.
